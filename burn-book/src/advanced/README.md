# Advanced

In this section we will cover advanced topics that goes beyond basic usage.
Since Burn aims to be extremely flexible, a lot of advanced use cases are possible.

We recommend going through the [basic-workflow](../basic-workflow/README.md) section as well as the [building blocks](../building-blocks/README.md) section before going through this one.
A solid fundation of how the framework works is crusial to understand the advanced section.
However, you can consume any advanced section in the order you want, since it isn't meet to be a linear sections like the previous ones, but a collection of usecases that you can refer to when you need more guidance.
